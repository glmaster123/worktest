## Pre-challenge Summary
My plan is to use a Kalman filter to reduce noise in the recorded GPS data. I also plan on viewing the KML file in Google Earth to see before/after to see if it worked. I will use NodeJS and an npm package for a javascript implementation of the Kalman Filter. The goal is to output a new json file. 

## Running the node script
```npm install```
```node smooth.js```
