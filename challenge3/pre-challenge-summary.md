## Pre-challenge Summary
For challenge #3 my plan is to create a mobile web application, separating the front and backend. I plan on using Vue.js and C#/.NET Core, respectively.

## Frontend
Using Vue.js and Bootstrap Vue I plan on creating a somewhat pleasing and easy to use interface. Bootstrap Vue is a component library that will help me speed up the coding process. For simplicity the frontend will mimic offline mode via a checkbox that the user can use to simluate lost network connection at will. In a real production environment the frontend would utilize a heartbeat that contacts the server periodically. Upon encountering a failed request due to dropped network connection, the application would go into offline mode while the heartbeat continues. Once a connection is restablished the frontend will attempt to sync by executing a request for each: creating any uncreated TodoItems, update any and that need updated, and deleting those that need to be deleted. If the server detects a concurrency issue for a request, that specific request will be aborted and the user will be notified. At the end of the sync, all TodoItems are refetched, regardless of succes/failure of requests. Offline mode is supported by utilizing the browser's local storage.

## Backend
The plan for the server will be to create a Web API .NET Core 3.1 and C#. I will also be using Entity Framework Core and SQLite for the database. The API will use the MVC design model. The database will be created using a migration tool that integrates with entity framework. For simplicity the CORS policy will as permissive as possible. Data Concurrency will be handled by adding a property to the TodoItem data model named `Version` which will be automatically populated/updated with every INSERT/UPDATE call. From there entity framework will automatically handle concurrency exceptions and the controller code will translate those into HTTP Bad Request responses for the frontend to use.

## Deployment/Demonstration
Rather than deploy to an Amazon instance or other external host I will run the application locally and publish the server URL using ngrok at the time of demonstration. If you would prefer to run the frontend application on your machine the instructions to do so are located in `todo-app/README.md`
